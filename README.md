### About
Programming and data analysis enthusiast.

<!--
For a long time I wanted to become a programmer, but exams or maybe fate itself went against me and in the end I received an engineering education in the field of control systems. I tried to learn programming on my own and miraculously managed to gain work experience, although unfortunately I was not able to hold out and grow in the end.

Now I know a lot of things related to data analysis, improved my knowledge in Python and C++, took part in a wonderful project and met wonderful people.

Despite all the difficulties and injustices of this harsh world, I continue to move forward, believing in the future.
